## Local development architecture

![Yas - local development architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nashtech-garage/yas/main/yas-architecture-local.png)

## Getting started with Docker Compose

1. Get the latest source code
2. Add the following records to your host file: 
```
127.0.0.1 identity
127.0.0.1 api.yas.local
127.0.0.1 pgadmin.yas.local
127.0.0.1 storefront
127.0.0.1 backoffice
127.0.0.1 loki
127.0.0.1 tempo
127.0.0.1 grafana
127.0.0.1 elasticsearch
127.0.0.1 kafka
```
3. Open terminal of your choice, go to `yas` directory, run `docker compose up`, wait for all the containers up and running

> *_Warning:_* To run all the containers, you need a minimum of 16GB of RAM. Otherwise, you can only run the core services with this command `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up`

4. All the containers up and running then we start source connectors by run script, open any terminal window... go to the YAS root folder and type: ./start-source-connectors.sh
5. Open your browser, now you can access the websites via `http://storefront/`; `http://backoffice/` login with admin/password

> *_Note:_* For the first run, the storefront and the backoffice might not work as expected. Stop all the containers (Ctrl + C) and run docker compose up again.

#### You might also want to explore:
1. `http://pgadmin.yas.local/`. Account login: `admin@yas.com` / admin. Register a server: postgres, port 5432, username admin, password admin. The Postgresql server is also exposed to the host machine: servername: localhost, port: 5432, username: admin, password: admin
2. `http://api.yas.local/swagger-ui/` for all the REST API document of all the services
3. `http://identity/` for Keycloak console, account admin/admin
4. `http://grafana/` for observability: log, trace, matrix
5. `http://elasticsearch/` for calling Elasticsearch APIs

#### About docker-compose files
1. docker-compose.yml for all core services
2. docker-compose.search.yml for search service
3. docker-compose.o11y.yml for observability services
